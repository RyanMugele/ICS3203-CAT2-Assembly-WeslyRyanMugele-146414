# ICS3203-CAT2 Assembly Practical Tasks

This repository contains solutions for the ICS3203 CAT2 Assembly programming tasks. Each program demonstrates a key concept in Assembly programming.

### Task 1: Control Flow and Conditional Logic
This program prompts the user to input a number and classifies it as "POSITIVE," "NEGATIVE," or "ZERO" using conditional and unconditional jumps.

### Challenges
- Managing input as characters required converting ASCII to integers.
- Using jumps (`JE`, `JL`, `JMP`) helped streamline branching logic.

### Task 2: Array Manipulation with Looping and Reversal
This program reverses an array of integers in place using loops and memory manipulation.

### Challenges
- Ensuring no additional memory was used for the reversal.
- Pointer management (start vs. end of the array) was critical.

### Task 3: Modular Program with Subroutines
This program computes the factorial of a number using a subroutine and demonstrates register preservation with the stack.

### Challenges
- Correctly managing the stack to prevent overwriting data.
- Recursive logic was simulated using calls and returns.

### Task 4: Data Monitoring and Control Simulation
This program simulates sensor-based actions (motor control and alarm triggering) based on input levels.

### Challenges
- Simulating ports using memory locations.
- Ensuring actions were taken only for specific conditions.
